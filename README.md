Design-and-Fabrication-of-a-Sheet-Metal-Bracket
This project focuses on designing a robust and lightweight sheet metal bracket using computer-aided design (CAD) software. It involves the use of sheet metal forming techniques to optimize the bracket's strength-to-weight ratio. The project explores manufacturing processes such as bending, punching, and stamping, and includes finite element analysis (FEA) to ensure structural integrity under various loading conditions.
